This hack features a blend between modern and old kaizo level design.\n\nThe main inspirations for the hack are familiar to most who play or watch these games\n\nThe Kaizo Mario trilogy\nBanzai Mario World\nGrand Poo World 1/2\n\nThis hack is fairly difficult and meant to serve as a sequel to Super Riff Wolrd. Much like the original it remains very largely vanilla (few custom enemies/gimmicks) although there is the odd custom thing here and there, similar to the first game.\n\nThe driving idea behind the hack was to constrain the design to similar limitations as the first, so it keeps that same feel. Working within those limitations was very difficult as it was very hard to continue to come up with ideas that felt fresh and fun while largely working with the same toolset as the original, which makes it hard to innovate. Hopefully those goals have been met as fun was the most important thing while designing it.\n\nThere\u2019s lots of tileset mixing, both foreground/background and sprites, which hopefully leads to some interesting and fresh combinations of enemies and themes.\n\nThe game does not feature what many consider to be common \u201Cquality of life\u201D patches or blocks, such as instant/prompt retry, nor does it feature instant death blocks, fast overworld, or auto save, however, these design choices were NOT made with the intent of punishing the player or being inconsiderate of their time etc. These were decisions that were not quickly or lightly made, and were largely to preserve the mood and feel of the game, which the levels are designed to reflect.\n\nThe design in the levels is very often intentionally lenient at the start of sections to prevent repeated death in a very short period of time. The obstacles are all designed around the idea of consistent \u201Cfirst cycling\u201D allowing the player to get back to where they were quickly once they know the level, and the sections are generally in the area of 35-45 in game seconds. All of these choices were made to compensate for what many consider mandatory features in modern kaizo hacks.\n\nObstacles are also designed so they can be played going quickly (one cycling) or taking your time to look at and size up. I have designed it in a way so going slowly will often change how you need to approach an obstacle. Sometimes an entire section may play differently, at times even similar to a non kaizo hack when played at a slower pace. \n\nI very often allow the player to respawn needed items for a second chance or to approach something in a non optimal way. For example killing enemies that serve as obstacles and then respawning the remaining setup to play in an easier manner, or using a cape to slowly fly through a section rather than use the fast one cycles built in.\n\nThe game features 32 exits and has taken nearly 3 years to complete. Thank you to all of the people who helped make this game, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without you.\n\nI have also included 3 versions of the game, one with custom music, one with vanilla music, and one with no music, so you can listen to your own!\n\nHope you have fun!","downloadURL":"//dl.smwcentral.net/26042/Riff%20World%202.zip"},{"title":"Luigi Stardust Adventure","imageURLs":null,"rating":4.69999981,"author":"Infinity","type":"Standard: Hard","exits":"65 exit(s)","description":"\nThe Full-Version hack of Luigi Stardust Adventure is here:\n\nCustom Block\nCustom Sprite\nCustom Patch\nCustom Music\nCustom GFXs\nCustom Uberasm","downloadURL":"//dl.smwcentral.net/25705/Luigi%20Stardust%20Adventure.zip"},{"title":"Kaizo Dreamland","imageURLs":null,"rating":-1,"author":"Chuck_Grump","type":"Kaizo: Light","exits":"4 exit(s)","description":"\nThis is the Demo to my first hack, Kaizo Dreamland.\nIt features a lot of custom sprites, music and graphics.\nA big shoutout goes to all the people in the german kaizo community who helped me get better at Lunar Magic.\n\nI hope you enjoy the demo, more will follow later this year.","downloadURL":"//dl.smwcentral.net/26043/KaizoDreamland.zip"},{"title":"NH World","imageURLs":null,"rating":4.5,"author":"l337f00l","type":"Kaizo: Light","exits":"6 exit(s)","description":"\nWelcome to New Hampshire World aka NH World.

However, Bowser has taken over this Kingdom creating problems for its inhabitants. Plus, he has gained some new allies as well in an attempt to prevent Mario from defeating him once more. Will Mario be able to defeat him, in addition to restoring peace here in Radish Kingdom?\n\nThe levels start of easy/normal at the beginning of this adventure. However, as the game and adventure progresses, the levels drastically become far more difficult along the way.\n\n\nThis hack features\n\nSingle player.\n\nSingle file\n\nDisabled cape flight so that the player will be forced to actually complete the levels naturally without \u0027cheating\u0027\n\nDisabled \u0027swimming\u0027 underneath certain water levels which would otherwise make it somewhat \u0027easier\u0027 to beat them, instead of doing it naturally\n\nShops in the first seven worlds so that the players can use their current amount of coins if they have any that is.\n\nCustom Music in every level.\n\nUnique Custom Palettes for every level.\n\nCustom blocks.\n\nAutosave.\n\nThere is a huge list of changes for this newer version which is included within the zip file of this hack itself, so feel free to read each and every one of the changes if you actually want to that is.\n\nchangelog V3\nThe bosses have received some significant changes to them in order for them to become somewhat of a challenge to the players\n\nThe midbosses for Worlds 1 to 4 can potentially be taken down in just three fireballs. But it is immune to the cape power up.\n\nThe midbosses for Worlds 5 to 7 take about three fireballs to actually consider it to be on par with a single jump just to damage it while it is immune to the cape feather just like the one for Worlds 1-4.\n\nThe midboss for World 8 is immune to the player\u0027s fireballs. So they will have to resort to either jumping on it or hurting it with the cape spin of their cape powerup.\n\nClucky\u0027s room now has a single fireball which of course would occasionally hop right out of the lava pit of the arena. He will also be hurt by fireballs the same way Mario would jump on him as a whole.\n\nWilliam of the Uprising Uptown castle can now be hurt by fireballs. And speaking of said castle, it now has a total of 500 seconds. And like Clucky before him, William will also be hurt by fireballs the same way the former would.\n\nChester of Miracle Mountain\u0027s castle will jump make the ground shake upon being at his last Hit Point, in addition to be being more vulnerable to the player\u0027s fireballs. In other words He will be hurt by fireballs as if he was jumped on the head by Mario himself.\n\nNimba\u0027s arena will now have a couple of pits to keep the player from actually running around the arena on purpose instead of fighting the boss as intended. Also if the player does land the final blow on Nimba, they will have to make sure that they do so while they are above or especially on any footing so that the player won\u0027t end up indirectly falling into one of the pits present. Thus, costing them the entire boss battle and the chance to head on to the next world. Speaking of Nimba, he is now at a slightly higher altitude than before. On the bright side, you can at least hurt him with the cape spin if you have the cape power present with you during the boss battle.\n\nOlivier now has a longer flashing frame time. Also after the checkpoint in the first room of his castle, there will be a message box for the player to inform them about the fact that they can actually kill the fishbones with their cape powerup.\n\nHector like Olivier before him, now has a much longer flashing frame upon taking damage from the player.\n\nArthur\u0027s room now has spikes in various parts of it especially on the floor to keep the player from potentially running around the room. Arthur however is a lot weaker to fireballs as they are strong enough to even consider it as a single hit like a jump would. But since attempting to jump on him would be a reckless decision, throwing his snowballs back at him is still a safer option if the player doesn\u0027t have the fire flower. On top of that, Arthur\u0027s earthquakes are capable of stunning the player for nearly a couple seconds and this can be extremely dangerous if the player is stunned right on the spikes in the boss room itself, especially if they are in their small form. Another thing, his castle now has a far more icy flavor to it, in terms level palette in general.\n\nFireballs thrown at Bowser now deal the same amount of damage as a normal jump would otherwise. But his flash time is significantly longer than the rest of the other bosses combined.\n\nThe background for 4-3 has been edited a little. And speaking of which the room that contains the key to the Red Switch Trial if the player has already cleared the Green one will now have three para spinys potentially keeping players from consider heading straight to the keyhole there a piece of cake.\n\n\nChangelog V3.1\nThe door in the first room of the 4th castle no longer leads straight to Nimba\u0027s arena as it now sends to player to the 2nd room just like in the previous versions before V3. Also the pits in his arena are slightly wider than before.\n\nFixed the introduction message\u0027s grammar a bit before the play can proceed to World 1\u0027s Overworld map.\n\nThere are now three nyolins in the second room of Hector\u0027s Castle\n\nThere are now four spike beds in Arthur\u0027s arena in his castle in addition to a small ceiling of spikes in the center of it.\n\nRemoved the pipe along with the fire spitting venus that was formerly above one of the Lakitus in 4-1.","downloadURL":"//dl.smwcentral.net/25875/Super%20Mario%20Radish%20Kingdom%20Adventure%20V3.1.zip"},{"title":"Super Mario: Nozom Quest (Level Sampler)","imageURLs":null,"rating":5,"author":"Stivi","type":"Standard: Hard","exits":"6 exit(s)","description":"\nThis is a small level sampler for Super Mario: Nozom Quest i released for C3.\nFormerly known as Super Mario Travellers.\nIn this sampler you can play any of the 6 levels from the first 5 worlds\n\nAll of the levels of this hack are being revamped, with better, more focused level design and more vibrant colors.\nTo add some gameplay variety, you can now play as Mario, Luigi and Glubita.

While there was some consideration for removing the level entirely, enough players enjoyed it that I decided to keep it.\n\nA few other quality of life changes have been implemented:\n\n-Vertical section for Watcher of the Skies now has a more responsive camera\n-Comfortably Numb is now correctly marked with a red, 2-exit level\n-Ports updated to use correct octave for percussion tracks\n-Music now plays while paused, at half volume\n-Fixed message box errors in Jungle Strut and in Karn Evil 9\n-LR Scroll has been properly disabled across all levels\n-Fixed a potential softlock at the end of the secret exit for Into the Fire\n-Fixed a bug where UghRochester wasn\u0027t appearing in the credits\n\nA big thanks to everyone who played the 1.0 version and gave crucial feedback.  I hope you enjoy this updated version, and with any luck, I\u0027ll see you all for Rock n Roll Set 2.\n\nStealth update: The overworld event for All Along the Watchtower has been updated to automatically save, instead of requiring the player to manually walk down to trigger the save.\nSU2: Players are no longer able to skip The Ocean.

Glitch has made an indelible impact on my life; this is the least I could do in return. This hack is meant to challenge him a bit, but still to be something he will enjoy.\n\nThat doesn\u0027t go for the rest of you. Glitch is one of the best SMW kaizo players out there, so building something to challenge him meant cranking up the difficulty. While I truly believe that I held back some and that a few sections might be more generally enjoyable, this hack isn\u0027t for beginner or even intermediate kaizo players.\n\nThere\u0027s quite a bit of item abuse in this hack. There\u0027s a midair shell jump. There are some precise cape maneuvers influenced by Pogyo\u0027s hacks. There\u0027s a custom boss built from scratch by the unholy yet sacred talents of dtothefourth. There are surfing disco shells and free-range chucks and slippery vines. It gets weird. It gets challenging.\n\nIf you would like to play a version without the midair level, please reach out via Discord or Twitter.

As the name implies, it is the sequel to Kruela Mario (and thus, this hack is completely in Esperanto!) but the level design has changed quite a bit: In contrast to the first hack, this is almost entirely devoid of kaizo design and instead focuses on being a puzzle hack. This however does not mean that the hack is easy and I strongly suggest the use of savestates, slowdown and a lua script as the glitches required in this hack are rather technical and sometimes difficult to execute. Of course, this presumes that you already figured out what to do, which (hopefully) is harder than executing the solution in most cases.\n\nKruela Mario 2 features an open overworld and every level is accessible from the start. This was done to prevent the player from getting stuck early on and never having a chance to see the later levels. However, the levels are still roughly ordered by difficulty and you should try them left-to-right, top-to-bottom. The earlier levels are fairly easy (for the genre) and some of them are completely trivial provided that you know the required glitch but I hope that the later levels are sufficiently difficult to accomodate for this. Another thing that drastically increases while you go along is the level length: While some of the earlier levels span less than 5 screens, the final levels are much longer.\n\nAs a lot of levels in this hack are reliant on \u0022difficulty by obscurity\u0022, this hack is not for you if you don\u0027t know a lot of glitches and/or are not willing to look up any of them. To give a more concrete example: The stun glitch is used a fair amount in this hack, so if you don\u0027t know what that is... you might want to play a different hack.\n\nThis hack was originally released during C3 Summer 2020.

This has made a lot of people very angry, and has been widely regarded to be a bad move. How, eleven years later, his sins repeat, and he finds he must once again travel home to right his wrongs.\n\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT IN THIS HACK\n\n\nMario left the Garage Door Open Again is a chocolate-lite Kaizo Light hack, with easy to medium difficulty, starting easier and curving upwards to medium towards the end. As I am not a Kaizo player, or even really a big SMW fan, the hack\u0027s design has been described as rather odd by the play testers, so expect to go \u0022what\u0022 a lot. There are also no trolls and traps. Trolling is boring. Mischief is the new meta.\n\n\nWHY IS THIS EVEN A THING, PLEASE TELL ME YOUR LIFE\u0027S STORY\n\n\nOkay, you don\u0027t have to shout.\n\nIn the early 2000s I was a member of the Acmlm\u0027s Board community, going by Samus Aran or Marzen. I never made anything important, certainly nothing you\u0027d care about (most of what I did was make two levels and give up in SMB3 or something), but it was a place for me to hang out and share in a fun hobby with friends. In the late 2000s I grew out of it, but that was right when SMW hacking started picking up. So I really hunkered down and tried my hand at making a romhack.\n\nIn 2009, I did that. Mario Left The Garage Door Up, a \u0022one and a half world\u0022 long romhack. It\u0027s honestly god awful, lots of cookie cutter design, and it literally only runs in ZSNES, cause that\u0027s what we had back then. I show it off sometimes to friends, but that\u0027s it. I never really tried to make anything else, because I\u0027m not even a big fan of SMW. I\u0027m a Sonic kid (as you can tell by my musical choices in this hack).\n\nSo, fast forward eleven years. I become good friends with some members of the Kaizo community. At the time I wasn\u0027t a fan of Kaizo, I thought the whole point was to be rude and make bad level design, and it made no sense to me. But my friends help me see the creativity and fun that can be had through it, so I start crafting the dumb idea of reviving my \u0022series\u0022. Three months and a lot of work and help from those friends later, I have the sequel to my hack you\u0027ve never played or heard of (It wouldn\u0027t be accepted to this site even if I submitted it).\n\nAs I had never played a Kaizo game before this (I\u0027ve since played Quickie World 2, it\u0027s good), the design is apparently very very odd, like if we were in a bizarro world and the meta of modern Kaizo hacks were just slightly different.\n\nThanks for reading this unnecessary backstory, hopefully you found it mildly entertaining. Enjoy the hack!\n\n\nSPECIAL THANKS\n\n\nSpecial thanks to Amethyst_Rocks, shovda, UndeadBlackBird, and iIIustrious for helping playtest this hack and make it not god awful bad. Credits are in the actual game for everyone who did everything. Shout outs to shout outs.\n\n\nCHANGELOG\n\n1.1\n\nFixed an issue where you can\u0027t go left on the map. Dunno how THAT got through, but rest assured, the game is actually beatable now.\n\nMinor bug fixes and palette changes and mustache fluffing\n\n1.1.1\n\nD4 showed me a fun thing they made so I added a text box you don\u0027t have to hit to V-Hold. This is worth updating the file on this site.","downloadURL":"//dl.smwcentral.net/23172/Mario%20Left%20The%20Garage%20Door%20Open%20Again.zip"},{"title":"Super Godly Worl 69","imageURLs":null,"rating":4.69999981,"author":"Godly","type":"Standard: Hard","exits":"2 exit(s)","description":"\nHey guys!

It was created with two goals in mind: Being extremely difficult (I think I succeeded with that goal), and utilizing as many uncommon glitches as possible.\n\nThis hack is mostly vanilla, apart from the graphics and the music, of course. There are however two custom blocks: The purple/black bars are instant death blocks that are passable for sprites, like the ones found in ColonThree. There are also On/Off blocks, but those are self-explanatory.\n\nIf you want to play this, be warned: This hack utilizes lots of unknown quirks of the vanilla SMW engine, some of which you might have never heard of. Most notably, this hack requires use of the pause button to control the sprite interaction frame rule. Also, some jumps are just very tight. Whenever you get stuck, try looking at the provided movie file for information on how to proceed.\n\nIf you prefer watching pit hacks over actually playing them, here\u0027s an encode of the provided movie file: https://youtu.be/7iqOdqphk7c\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nChangelog v1.1:\n- Changed the blocks in the second room to act like castle spikes instead of munchers. This fixes an exploit allowing you to skip the entire room with an item-swapped silver p-switch. Thanks to TheBiob for finding this.\n\nChangelog v1.2:\n- Removed a non-solid boulder tile and added a few spikes in the cape flying section, preventing a zip that allowed you to skip the entire room. The total object count stays the same so unless you were planning to abuse this in a TAS, nothing changes for you (the provided movie file synced without a change).

Mute gathers gifts from the newly built Toad Town for Princess Cecilia, Lumine, and Allen Yoshi (the same Yoshi from \u0022Super Yoshi Land: The Rescue Mission\u0022 as well as The After Years). As Mute and Cecilia talk, Yoshi alerts them that the gifts have been stolen by a couple crooks that went off to \u0022The Abandoned Tower\u0022. Mute offers to get the gifts back, and thus his new quest begins in this new chapter.\n\nThe game contains a lot of inside jokes from EvilGuy0613\u0027s discord server that are hidden as easter eggs throughout the two levels, as well as giving the characters much more difference between each other.

It perfectly times with C3, too!\n\nMario and Luigi have been invited for afternoon tea at Peach\u0027s Castle with herself and Daisy. However, when the brother\u0027s arrive, Daisy is kidnapped by Bowser and takes all the power stars! Mario must save the kingdom by getting the power stars back from the Koopalings to power their ship across the Lava Seas to save Princess Daisy.\n\nThis hack is based around mostly Super Mario All-Stars graphics (mainly SMB3, but with light sprinkles of SMB1 and SMB2) but also features a good amount of other, well fitting custom tilesets from various sources. It properly implements abilities from modern Mario games, such as wall kicking and ground pounding, a load of unique custom sprites specifically coded for the hack and of course, plenty of powerups to keep you entertained. The hack also has it\u0027s own custom bosses, and you can defeat four of the Koopalings (Larry, Morton, Wendy and Iggy) in this demo, as well as face off against Boom Boom and Pom Pom.\n\nI hope you enjoy playing!

Note that this hack is not meant to be the easiest Kaizo hack; it provides you the tools and knowledge needed to beat most Kaizo hacks. This hack is also not a Super Mario World encyclopedia. It is not meant to teach you about every single glitch, trick, or enemy. Instead, Kaizo Kindergarten teaches you about fundamental mechanics and physics of the game that can be used to apply to any situation.\n\nI have also included a Google Doc that contains all the text featured in the game.\nThis can be used as a reference if you want to look up certain mechanics.\n\nI have also included a Google Sheet that contains all assets used in the hack.\nIf you are wondering who made what, or what song was included, you reference the sheet.\n\nLastly, I will be providing a YouTube playlist that contains a full walkthrough (with extensive commentary) of the hack. Be sure to check the submission text for the latest links and updates!\n\nDisclaimer: this tutorial hack only covers mechanics of vanilla Super Mario World. Note that custom hacks can, at any time, change the physics of the original game. Please consult the readme of each hack to see if any changes were applied. If the creator did not include a readme, they should be banned from making hacks.\n\nThis hack will probably not make you a Kaizo god overnight, either.\n\nWARNING: this hack contains trolls, which may not be suitable for tilted gamers. Player discretion is advised.\n\nThank you for playing!\n\nOnce you have completed the hack, I would recommend playing Baby Kaizo World or Quickie World. Those are two good introductory Kaizo hacks to begin with. If you are feeling adventurous, try playing Super Dram World. :)\n\nI also strongly suggest going back to play the original Kaizo Mario World series. I believe it is important to understand where and how many of the Kaizo hacks nowadays stem from. This gives you a perspective as a player on how and why certain design elements exist in Kaizo levels.\n\nI expect a version 1.1 to come out eventually.\n\nFIXME: The 2-Player bonus level access is somewhat broken. Requiring dragon coins to access rooms without a patch to save collected dragon coins makes this hack required to be played in one session, in order to achieve 100% completion. Additionally, the 2-player path is disconnected from the main world with no unlockable path back there, which means player 1 has to watch the player 2 cutscene 41 times in order to 100% the game, and will lose all progress and render the file unwinnable if that session is interrupted. Since this is a tutorial hack, I recommend having the 2-player area as an entirely separate demo hack and removing the dragon coins completely. As for the levels themselves, \u0022Block Break\u0022 has a glitch on one of the tiles that sends Luigi back to the main overworld and cuts off access from the First Grade area. In \u0022Double Jump\u0022, there is a trick which requires direction luck, speed luck, position luck, *and* frame rule luck. For a human, this trick is only possible much less than 10% of the time.","downloadURL":"//dl.smwcentral.net/20091/Kaizo%20Kindergarten%20v1.09.zip"},{"title":"The Underground","imageURLs":null,"rating":4.80000019,"author":"algae5","type":"Kaizo: Light","exits":"11 exit(s)","description":"\nMario has fallen deep into The Underground.\n\nExplore an lore-driven kaizo hack carefully crafted with interspersed custom and vanilla elements. The Underground will be a challenge to many players, but focuses on fun and consistent platforming to attempt to be accessible and enjoyable to anyone with kaizo experience who picks it up. \n\nI make no apologies. The Underground is difficult and precise at times, but I strove to make a hack that rewards the player for their effort. I believe that something as difficult as The Underground must be designed to reward the player for following the steps. A brilliant symphony\u0027s sonic glory rewards the musicians who practiced and rehearsed, a delicious dish rewards the patient chef\u0027s experimentation. Be it the satisfaction of executing impressive visual tricks, the achievement of optimizing and making yourself more skilled at controlling Mario, or the joy when you cross the goal tape. Chase after your dreams and never turn back.\n\n\nThis hack features 11 exits filled with secrets to discover, bosses, cape, custom music, top-down designed levels, custom graphics, regrabs, and custom behavior. I believe that the creative method does not create from nothing. This hack is inspired by a slew of incredible games and works of art that came before me. Throughout the hack, astute players will find obstacles and levels in homage to other games, such as Grand Poo World 2, Storks and Apes and Crocodiles, Kaizo Mario World, Super Dram World, and many more.\n\nNewer players are recommended to avoid the secret exits, which prove to be more challenging than the normal exits.","downloadURL":"//dl.smwcentral.net/20204/The%20Underground.zip"},{"title":"Robfather World","imageURLs":null,"rating":4.69999981,"author":"DanOfMostTrades","type":"Kaizo: Light","exits":"14 exit(s)","description":"\nAre you having trouble breaking into Kaizo?

It is 100% vanilla outside of modified bosses and custom music, and I really tried to push the creativity while making obstacles that were easy to read and fun to pull off.

I hope you, gentle player, will come to feel the same way. There is no overworld to this hack (automatic saving), simply 17 \u002B 1 levels of bullshit from a sadist. The hack is directly inspired by the Luigi\u0027s Adventure lost levels and incidentally inspired by the Hyper Mario World special worlds, and so occupies the border territory between very hard and kaizo, depending on whether you view kaizo as a genre or a difficulty, or just think it\u0027s a Japanese magazine. There are few if any of the traditional kaizo traps (invisible blocks, post-goal deaths), or techniques (shell-jumping), but the expectation that the level be played in a strict way, and the certain necessity for trial and error or familiarity with the course lay-out, lead me to feel the classification I\u0027ve given it (kaizo light) is accurate. I hope you have fun. \n\nLove, morsel.\n\nv1.13\nThis post-seppuku update fixes the two game crashes in stage 5.

This is the absolute final version--rather than update this again, I will commit seppuku.\n\nv1.11\n\u0022I shouldn\u0027t have to update this again.\u0022 When I said this, a nasty little god laughed. Hence \u0022stabilised max sliding speed\u0022--this was well motivated but completely idiotic; not sure how to fix it without breaking other things, so it has now been reverted to normal. Also forgot these changes:\n-Stage 13: fixed a sparky so he doesn\u0027t despawn.\n-Stage 15: in boss, set layer 2 to interact with sprites.\n\nVersion 1.10\nI wanted to update the hack as there was a bug in stage 10 whereby the p-switch occasionally wouldn\u0027t spawn. I still don\u0027t know what causes this, but I put in some code to take account of it happening. I took the opportunity to go over the hack and fix some other things, viz.:\n-Stage 1: stabilised max sliding speed (to $30, instead of values between $2F and $31). This also applies to other stages with sliding obstacles (stage 2, stage 12, some stage 17 sublevels).\n-Stage 3: made one jump easier and added a hint for a blind thing.\n-Stage 5: fixed the part where you can go under everything.\n-Stage 9: made football player kick consistently.\n-Stage 10: fixed disappearing p-switch bug.\n-Stage 12: changed music.\n-Stage 13: changed music and palette for second half. Everyone seems to find the second half pretty hard so I made it more lenient. Also disabled the killing of thwomps and thwimps with blocks (it is unreliable and confusing).\n-Stage 14: made the first half more streamlined to reduce potential waiting.\n-Stage 16: fixed the jump where you can skip one of the disco ball obstables.\n-Stage 17: changed boss music.\n-Motor Skills: fixed beginning of room 4; made first hit of boss more consistent; fixed final hit of boss so you need to be standing on ground for it to count.\nThere are miscellaneous other changes for small graphical anomalies and text box messages.

But do not worry, for you will never lose your power-ups! Instead, you have a health system replacing the lives system. So any time you gather a 1-up, you\u0027ll gain more health, allowing the player to take more hits. You take 2 damage every time an enemy hits you, and you have a maximum of 99 health. While this seems like a stretch, I wanted to keep the maximum health counter to its vanilla counterpart, and plus if you fall into lava or into a pit you go back to 5 health anyway.\n\nThere are 16 exits with 60 collectable BongoKitty coins (replacing the vanilla dragon coins).

I highly recommend playing it before entering the levels.\n\nNORMAL GAME: \nIts the normal game with an open overworld. You can play the rooms any order you want. Will have to fight a boss every 8 beaten levels. 96 rooms/12 bosses total.\n** Important: Bosses will keep appearing on unbeaten levels until you beat them. So even if you press start\u002Bselect to exit the boss and enter another unbeaten level you will have to fight the boss again and beat it to save your progress. They will not show up if you enter a level that has been beaten already.\n\nRACE: \nThis mode will select either 8, 16 or 24 random rooms to play based on a given number sequence. Can be used for a fun race with friends or maybe for some random practice. \nTwo-player mode can be used for fun team races (Alternate players every death).\n(Notice that some levels have higher probability of getting selected, and theres a very VERY VERY small chance of getting some levels repeated.)\n\n\nAbout the 2-player mode:\nDue to some weird bugs the two-player mode of the \u0022normal game\u0022 was removed. So even if the two-player mode is selected the game will remain as a one-player game.\nTutorial and race can be played by two players, alternating players every death.\n\n\nWith all that said, intermediate and advanced players will probably have the most fun of it. \nBeginners will probably have a hard time figuring out what to do or perfoming it. \nBut don\u00B4t get discouraged, beating this hack will raise your kaizo skills by at least 360%!!

Super Mario Bros. 1 was my very first video game and I grew up on Super Mario Bros 3 and thought it was the best thing ever. I really don\u0027t remember when I first played Super Mario World but it wasn\u0027t until a long, long while after I played Super Mario Bros 3 (at that point I already had Super Mario All Stars) However, probably over a decade later after having played it, I\u0027m still playing it, and still loving it. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll ever outgrow classic Mario platforming. That\u0027s probably why I liked SMW hacks so much. I\u0027d play a ton of them, even long after normal people likely would have gotten bored since a lot of hacks are still basically Super Mario World.\n\nI\u0027ve made no attempt to really set myself apart to that end, because when it comes down to it, that\u0027s what I\u0027m here for; classic Mario platforming. Back during a time when we were actually excited to rescue the Princess again. Back during a time when we could separate levels by world and the levels told you what world they belonged to. Back during a time where there weren\u0027t any funky control gimmicks, weird goals or anything that distracted you from the overall feel that it was a Mario game, nothing more, nothing less. Just straight up run, jump, shoot fireballs, swing your cape, stomp on enemies and stuff like that. I\u0027ve made this hack with that in mind, it\u0027s nothing but classic Mario platforming. Don\u0027t expect anything flashy, both on part of that and on part of my general inexperience and laziness in hacking.\n\nThere are eight primary worlds, an extra world, a star world that connects various places, and a special, secret world that will test your mettle (and patience.) The goal of every level is to reach the end, and possibly fight a boss such as a koopaling once you do. Many levels have secret exits that are usually opened by taking a key to a keyhole, as per usual Super Mario World fare. There\u0027s many features and gimmicks to many levels, but the feeling of classic Mario platforming typically stays the same. The story is always the same; Mario goes on an adventure to save his friends and the Princess from the evil King Bowser, and along the way jumps, shoots and even flies through the land in search of the castles controlled by Bowser\u0027s underlings.\n\n\n~Tester notes~ There are a few minor sounds bugs here and there but nothing game breaking and usually only when you enter specific levels.","downloadURL":"//dl.smwcentral.net/15587/avsmw.zip"},{"title":"Super Panga World","imageURLs":null,"rating":4.5,"author":"Linkdeadx2","type":"Kaizo: Light","exits":"14 exit(s)","description":"\nMy first romhack in the style of kaizo is dedicated to PangaeaPanga(creator of Item Abuse 3 and Super Dram World).

Luigi opened it up and saw the most beautiful Gem he had ever seen. It glowed all 7 colors of the rainbow, and seemed to give off its own light. Peach said she had found it washed up on the beach as she came to the Bros House. The Bros, being very Humble and modest, declined Peach\u0027s gift, and told her to keep the precious gem for herself. Peach agreed to do so. After several hours of joyous conversation, the Mario Bros. and Peach decided to go to sleep, the gem tucked carefully in Peach\u0027s pocket.\n\nIn the middle of the night, a great tropical storm began brewing near the Bros.\u0027 island house. Lightning crashed, thunder rolled, and giant waves crashed along the beaches. Suddenly the window of the Bros\u0027 house smashed open, and suddenly Peach vanished before the Bros.\u0027 could react at all. The storm raged harder outside, making it impossible to see, or even hear anything. The Bros were stuck in their house for the remainder of the night.\n\nOnce the storm subsided, the Bros. went out to investigate. The sun was shining as brightly as ever, and nothing seemed out of place, except for the broken window in their beloved house. Mario decided to go look for Peach, while Luigi stayed back to fix up the window.\n\nWhile searching Mario found nothing. No Koopa Kids, no ransom notes from Bowser, no Toads crying for help. Nothing. Mario sat down beneath a nearby oak tree to rest. He took his ever-stylish custom (M) hat off, and rested. Upon sitting down, he noticed some storm clouds were still in the sky above a far off island. Without any leads this seemed to be the most logical place for Peach to be... but how could a storm simply make a person vanish into thin air without a trace? Mario went back to the house and told Luigi what he had seen. Luigi finished up fixing the window (trying to stall the adventure), and finally Mario and Luigi set out on a quest to find Peach, the Mysterious Gem, and the Truth...\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a Collection of 3 Versions of my hack I have made over the past 3 years.\n\nThere is Patch for Each year (2007,2008,2009), Each Patch a definitive Upgrade from the previous year.\n\nThe reason I include all 3 is because there is so many levels, and ideas I had that been remade, and redone. It allows you to see how these levels evolved into what they are now. It\u0027s pretty cool :)\n\nI recommend playing the 2009 patch first, since its the best :)\n\nAnyways, I stopped working on my hack, right before Custom Music came out, so don\u0027t expect anything TOO flashy. Although with what I had I have managed to produce some pretty serious results, and the Level Design hopefully won\u0027t leave you unsatisfied either.\n\nThere\u0027s been reports that you get stuck at a certain castle entrance without a powerup... Try running around the bushes. Maybe you can find some fungi.\n\nAlso, yes, there is a load of slowdown at certain hectic points. Apologies in advance. When I was testing it, it seemed fine, but creating the patch seems to have introduced some heavy slowdown in spots.\n\nWell, enough from me. The best way to see something is to see it for yourself right?\n\nDownload, Play, and Comment.\n(And Remember, that when you rate this hack, that it is an OLD hack, that never got to see any of these newer tools, or patches!)\n\nThanks!","downloadURL":"//dl.smwcentral.net/9926/Archipelago%20of%20Truth%20Collection.zip"},{"title":"Mario\u0027s Sweet Adventure","imageURLs":null,"rating":3.0999999,"author":"niko","type":"Standard: Normal","exits":"7 exit(s)","description":"\nThank you all for the feedback! :)\nVersion 0.4\n\u002B Fixed Castle 1 second Room\n\u002B 2 new levels\n\u002B fixed overworld\nPlease tell me, when you find a bug or glitch! :)","downloadURL":"//dl.smwcentral.net/12794/Marios%20Sweet%20Adventure%20Demo%204.zip"},{"title":"Super Mario Bros.: The Minus World","imageURLs":null,"rating":4.30000019,"author":"Lexi","type":"Standard: Normal","exits":"4 exit(s)","description":"\n(MODERATOR NOTE: This hack should be played in ZSNES to avoid music glitches.)\n\nAfter the cancellation of my first project, SMW: Remix, I have made a newer, better, and much more fun hack!\nThis is Demo 0.1, and contains World 1.\n\nfixme: custom music glitch causes crash in accurate emulators.

The Koopa Troop has invaded and done something unfathomable: NOT kidnapping Princess Peach! Instead, they merely took one Grand Star and delivered it to Bowser. Luigi and Mario set off to liberate the Mushroom Kingdom and recover the Grand Star, and find out what Bowser has up his sleeve that he\u0027d do something so fundamentally against his MO.\n\nThis hack has been tested and confirmed to work on the following emulators:\n-Snes9x 1.53\n-Higan (Accuracy Build) 0.94\n-ZSNES 1.51 (sort of...see below)\nOther emulators have not been tested, but should work. Also, since it works on Higan Accuracy (aka, the closest possible software to a real SNES,) it should also work on a real SNES, if you have a flash cart.\n\nA NOTE ABOUT ZSNES 1.51: This emulator seems to have more problems with slowdown than other emulators that have been tested. Slowdown is still present at times in the other emulators, but not as much. Therefore, Snes9x or Higan will work best for this hack. You CAN still use ZSNES if you must (there\u0027s no awful game-breaking glitches or anything,) just keep this in mind. Though considering the security problems of ZSNES that have recently come to light and the fact SMW Central no longer requires hacks to work on ZSNES due to said issues, you may be better off just not using ZSNES at all.","downloadURL":"//dl.smwcentral.net/12758/Super%20Luigi%20-%20The%20Regular%20Quest%20DEMO%201.2.zip"},{"title":"Mario \u0026 Luigi: Starlight Island Adventure","imageURLs":null,"rating":4.19999981,"author":"Gamma V","type":"Standard: Normal","exits":"44 exit(s)","description":"\n(Rev. 06)\n\nMario \u0026 Luigi: Starlight Island Adventure is a total revamp and reworking of Super Mario Starlight Remix.

My name is Michael Stark. You might know me as an administrator on board2. Several years ago, I made a Mario World hack named \u0022Mario\u0027s Return.\u0022 While I liked the core of it, it had many flaws and could have been much better than it was. It also had a number of very odd glitches. I thought about showing it to some friends of mine about a month ago, but realized that there was just so much about it that was utterly ameteurish in terms of design... It would not have been very flattering for me.\n\nWith that in mind, I tossed around the idea of going back through it and fixing up a few things from here to there. It didn\u0027t go anywhere for awhile, but at one point, I found spare time, and I set to work. It quickly developed beyond just making it a bit better; I wanted this to actually be something worth playing, rather than the forgettable trash that most ROM hacks end up as.\n\nI went through many levels, especially the most linear ones, and touched things up, adding a few extra paths and items here and there, and adjusted the difficulty curve to be in general more forgiving but basically just more consistent. I also completely remade a few parts which I just didn\u0027t like. One level in particular, Secret 3, was basically utter trash, and I replaced it completely. I went out of my way to find complaints about the previous release and address them. For various reasons, I couldn\u0027t address all of them, but I won\u0027t say I didn\u0027t do my damnedest. I also rewrote pretty much all the text in the game, as it was quite poor before.\n\nIn addition to general touchups and making it suck less, I also added a small amount of completely new content. I added a new Big Boo fight to replace a Reznor fight in the secret path of the last fortress. Further, one of the most common things that people said is that there\u0027s no real \u0027reward\u0027 for getting everything. Now, however, completing the secret world grants a new final level, which is... Interesting. I like how the whole thing turned out, to be certain.\n\nStill, if you have played the original \u0022Mario\u0027s Return\u0022 then there\u0027s not much that will surprise you - this is very much the same hack, it\u0027s just been polished.\n\nThis is a beta not in the commonly-seen sense of \u0022I want to show something off even though I\u0027m not done,\u0022 but rather in the professional sense of \u0022I think this is done, but if testers find problems then I will address them before distributing the completed product.\u0022 One thing in particular that you should keep in mind, however, is that this is very much a hack from 2006, and I have kept my old sensibilities. There\u0027s little ExGFX, and all graphics retain their simple, \u0022everything is the same style, nothing is out of place in Mario World\u0022 aesthetic. I also am retaining the game\u0027s original music, because I like it, and I feel that it fits. There are a few custom sprites, but nothing made with Sprite Tool or what have you, because that tool was not available to me when I released the hack the first time. With that said...\n\nThis hack contains 88 exits across 68 levels.","downloadURL":"//dl.smwcentral.net/9878/MRA%20Beta.zip"},{"title":"The Saga - Kame","imageURLs":null,"rating":3,"author":"Rauy Style","type":"Standard: Hard","exits":"7 exit(s)","description":"\nHISTORY: The new son of Bowser, tired to follow orders of its father, decides to become new King Koopa\u2026\n\nHDMA:No\nCUSTOM MUSIC:Yes\nCUSTOM BLOCK:Yes\nCUSTOM SPRITES:Yes\nCUSTOM BOSS:Yes\nExGFX:Yes\n\nCredits: In the final version\u2026 Next version: Only the complete version\u2026\n\nObs:FadeFix it was placed, but it does not function with all BGs.\nfixme: music breaks on accurate emulators.","downloadURL":"//dl.smwcentral.net/9875/The%20Saga%20-%20Kame.zip"},{"title":"Mario Curse Hunter","imageURLs":null,"rating":3.70000005,"author":"Jead","type":"Standard: Hard","exits":"11 exit(s)","description":"\nMario Curse Hunter.\nFixed a few errors and uglyness.

People on youtube have called me awesome, the best they have ever seen, and one time,\n a genius.  Though I know for certain that some of them might have been exaggerating, my levels will definitely entertain you, and they are well put together.  Not everybody will think this, but I am pretty sure you will, and maybe think even more...  \n\nStory- Bowser has tricked Mario into getting inside of a very strange glass box, called The Unworld.  It is a very strange world in\n there... Mario, inside, asks you to help get him out of there using the controller connected to the box.  It is up to\nyou to lead Mario out of the Unworld and back to the real world in time to stop Bowser! Expect some humorous comments \nand a some-what storyline within this.  \n\nTo get to Bowser in the regular, just getting one normal exit after another path, will take you 33 exits.  However, if you are a player \nwho likes looking for secret exits, finding new Overworld areas and paths, then you will have a whole 93 exits to find. \nI only used Lunar Magic and the instant Death blocks in this hack, so I would call it a vanilla hack (I guess?)  This hack\nhas, in my opinion and that of others\u0027, a very nice difficulty curve, where it is pretty easy in the beginning and slowly gets much much harder.\nMany levels have hidden bonuses and secret surprises... So, what are you waiting for? Download this and have fun!  \n\nAlso, a note- you may discover some glitches, but if you do, I doubt it will be anything major, I have played \nthrough this a bazillion times.   \n\nOh yeah, and since this is The Unworld, expect to see some interesting palettes...

Picking up where Mario\u0027s Strange Quest left off, it turns out that the part where Yoshi\u0027s eggs hatched at the end of MSQ didn\u0027t actually happen. What really happened after Mario beat Bowser, rescued Yoshi\u0027s eggs, and saved the princess was that Yoshi and his sleepy friend decided to move to a new land so that he can protect his eggs from Bowser before they really hatched. So, both Yoshis do so and they find themselves in the land of Weirdonia. However, it seems that Bowser apparently insists on stealing Yoshi\u0027s eggs, since Yoshi\u0027s eggs were stolen again while Yoshi was out shopping. Since Mario isn\u0027t around to help this time, Yoshi goes on a quest by himself to retrieve his eggs. However, just like Mario\u0027s Strange Quest, this isn\u0027t your ordinary quest.

The Catholian Interplanetary Fleet, unprepared, was almost crushed. But two brave men, Byron Langhorn and Mark Electra, formed a special, elite faction to battle the invaders: The Skaylian Resistance Force. Through their efforts, the invasion was stopped, but to take out the Megacorp mothership, Mark was forced to sacrifice his life. It was through his sacrifice that peace returned to the system.\n\nBut now, ten years later, Zyclon has sworn his revenge. He has returned with a stronger force than ever. But this time, Langhorn has prepared. He has assembled a new SRF, led by Mark\u0027s hot-headed, tomboyish daughter, Skye. Together they fight the Megacorp menace...\n\nOne day, Skye and the SRF were ambushed by Megacorp in the depths of space. Skye and her partner, Joan Hilsgoph, managed to escape in a small space-pod, but the rest of the crew was captured by the evil Megacorp, who hope to harvest their powerful life-force, Honouran Energy, and fuel a superweapon with the potential to rip the entire dimension apart. Skye, Joan, and Acer, the new guy at Tech Support, must put a stop to Megacorp and save the crew before the universe\u0027s fate is sealed!

Don\u0027t worry if difficulty hacks scare you though, many of the early levels are still easy and there is a sincere attempt at level design and variety.\n\nThis hack improves on the original version in the following ways:\n\n1. All Koopa Kids, Bowser, and Reznor are more difficult, keeping with the tone of the hack.\n\n2. Lag is considerably reduced.\n\n3. Sprite memory is improved in a few stages\n\n4. Various bugs, some minor, some major, have been either eliminated or minimized.\n\n5. A few minor level edits to fix bugs, such as removing Yoshi in Forest of Illusion 3 and removing the final Pokey in Chocolate Island 5, and one major level edit with Yoshi\u0027s Island 3 now featuring a faster scroll.\n\nThe hack is about 95% the same, but the changes generally make things more difficult. Unlike the original, it is not a pure vanilla hack as it takes advantage of a few patches and hex edits to tweak a few things here and there. However, it still resembles a vanilla hack in all essential ways, and those few changes ultimately allow it to play much better than the original version.","downloadURL":"//dl.smwcentral.net/5294/The%20New%20Mario%20World%20V1.1.zip"},{"title":"Sendy\u0027s World","imageURLs":null,"rating":3.5,"author":"Anonymous","type":"Standard: Hard","exits":"27 exit(s)","description":"\nDemo v0.3","downloadURL":"//dl.smwcentral.net/5074/sendysworldv0.3.zip"},{"title":"Mario Gives Up 2","imageURLs":null,"rating":4.5999999,"author":"cyphermur9t","type":"Standard: Hard","exits":"95 exit(s)","description":"\nPlay the first Mario Gives Up if you like plot.\n\nThis is a continuation of the first Mario Gives Up.

All the levels from the original are completely changed and much harder than the original game.

It fixed a lot of mistakes the original game had and adds lot of new stuff.\nStill, I think it would be wrong to get rid of the original version just because the remake is out.

Although the hack can be played through normally in half an hour, you can revisit the levels to find new paths and many secrets. The difficulty ranges from very easy to very hard, the hardest sections being well hidden for the best players to find. Expect plenty of original gameplay ideas and nicely designed environments.","downloadURL":"//dl.smwcentral.net/5609/Tsunami%20Island.zip"}]
